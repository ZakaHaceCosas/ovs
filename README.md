# OpenVendeSys

A simple project I made for a customer. It's an app written in ElectronJS and TypeScript that allows for simple item stock management. Made open source for no reason, but it kinda works.

Version 2 (deprecated, but fully functional) is available [here](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/openvendesys/releases/tag/2.1.0), in case you wanted to try it out.

I am working on Version 3.0, occasionally committing code here.
